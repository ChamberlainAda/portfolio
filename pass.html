        <h2>So much to give</h2>
        <p>
            Heard, faintly... <br>
            My love drips, like raindrops, <br>
            From an overflowing heart, <br>
            Once turned to ice, <br>
            Now, melting away, slowly, <br>
            As I long, to be with you, <br>
            To finally, find you! <br>
            Simply because, <br>
            I have so much, <br>
            Love to give! <br>
        </p>

        <p><b>User Level Threads</b>: Firstly, a thread shares information in the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">operating system</a> like data segment, code
            segment
            files etc.
            with its peer threads while it contains its own registers, stack, counter etc.
            Now the User Level Threads are implemented by users and the kernel is not aware of the existence of these
            threads.
            It handles them as if they were single-threaded processes.
            User-level threads are small and much faster than kernel level threads.
            They are represented by a program counter <sup>(PC)</sup> , stack, registers</p>

        <p>
            Kernel-level threads are handled by the operating system directly and the thread management is done by the
            kernel.
            The context information for the process as well as the process threads is all managed by the kernel.
            Because of this, kernel-level threads are slower than user-level threads.
